Im am a very _perfeccionist_ person, wich means that sometimes I find it hard to let other people do certain works. But in the end, I work for the best result posible. 
Aside fromm that, I **love** music. I don't dislike any genre, I am just _more into_ some of them more than others. I enjoy a little sesion of **pop** followed by some **classic music**. I mean, Mozart and Beethoven have some bangers! 
I am a **passionate** person when it comes to musicals. I would rant to you about my favourites for hours and most likely make you love them because they are the best. I love how _SiX_ tells you about the 6 wives Henry VIII had in a very humoristic way. How _Hamilton_ tells you about the US founding fathers using, rap... **RAP!**. And let's not forget about the classic _The Lion King_. Dont't lie to me... you also cried when Mufasa died ðŸ˜¢
